# NuGet Vulnerability Scan

## Features

Scans the NuGet dependencies of the found project files via `dotnet list ${projectPath} package --vulnerable --include-transitive`.
The task fails, if any of the found projects contains warnings of one of the following levels:
- Critical
- High
- Moderate

NEW:
- Failing task if no projects found
- Parallelizing check for performance

## NET Framework

As the project structure changed between the NET Framework and NET Core, this task doesn't work out of the box with NET Framework projects.
But you can use the script from Bas Litjten and the description [here](https://blog.baslijten.com/how-to-use-the-new-dotnet-nuget-security-vulnerabilities-scanning-for-packages-config-and-net-full-framework-in-3-simple-steps/) to prepare a csproj-file, which can then be used by the vulnerability scan task.

## Configuration

### Path to project(s)

A [glob pattern](https://www.malikbrowne.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-glob-patterns) to the respective projects.

### Include transitive dependencies

Defines wheter the scan also checks the transitive dependencies.

### Threshold for failure

Defines the threshold, when the task should fail.
